# jamesm2w / ParliamentDiagram

This is a Node.js and Vue.js rewrite of the [original parliament diagram creator](https://github.com/slashme/parliamentdiagram) designed for use on Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata. 
My motivation was to create a modern web application to allow for a faster and easier workflow. All credit for the algorithms which generated the diagrams go to the original authors [David Richfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Slashme), [Mathis Rade](https://github.com/Rade-Mathis), [Ranjith Siji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ranjithsiji) and [Ambady Anand S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ambadyanands).
